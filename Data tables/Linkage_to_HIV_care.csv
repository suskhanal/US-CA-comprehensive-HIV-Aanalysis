Footnote(s): Data for 2023 and 2024 are considered preliminary (subject to a 12-month reporting delay). Inclusion of preliminary data in trend assessments is discouraged. Numbers less than 12͵ and rates and percentages based on these numbers͵ should be interpreted with caution. HIV diagnoses and PrEP data for the year 2020͵ which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic͵ should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the pandemic on access to HIV testing͵ PrEP prescriptions͵ and care-related services. Data by transmission category presented based on sex assigned at birth and are adjusted for missing transmission category. See Technical notes for more details on data availability and stratifications.
   Linkage to care is based on cases diagnosed during the year queried.
   The 'Sex' column is used for either sex assigned at birth or gender identity.
   NA - Not applicable.
