Title: "HIV Stigma | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 (COVID-19 Pandemic) | 2021 | 2022 | California | All races/ethnicities | Both sexes | Ages 13 years and older | All transmission categories""
Footnote(s): 
   Weighted percentages for unstable housing or homelessness and median HIV stigma scores are reported in the ‘Rate per 100͵000’ column with corresponding 95% confidence intervals reported in the ‘Rate LCI’ and ‘Rate UCI’ columns within the Charts and Maps tools or in parentheses within the ‘Rate per 100͵000’ column within the Tables tool.
   To allow for comparison with other HIV indicators͵ data are presented for persons aged ≥13 years and aged 13-24 years. However͵ these estimates are representative of persons with diagnosed HIV aged ≥18 years and 18-24 years͵ respectively. 
   For unstable housing or homelessness͵ estimates with a coefficient of variation ≥0.30 or those based on a denominator sample size less than 30 were suppressed. For HIV stigma͵ estimates based on a denominator sample size less than 30 were suppressed.
   See Technical Notes for more details on data availability͵ stratifications͵ and variable definitions.
   * Estimates with an absolute CI width ≥30͵ estimates with an absolute CI width between 5 and 30 and a relative CI width greater than 130%͵ and estimates of 0% or 100% should be interpreted with caution.
   The 'Sex' column is used for either sex assigned at birth or gender identity.
