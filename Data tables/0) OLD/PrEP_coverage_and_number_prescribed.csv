Footnote(s): PrEP coverage͵ reported as a percentage͵ is calculated as the number of persons aged ≥16 years classified as having been prescribed PrEP divided by the estimated number of persons aged ≥16 years who had indications for PrEP. To allow for comparison with other HIV indicators͵ data are presented for ≥13‒ and 13‒24-year-olds͵ but represent ≥16‒ and 16‒24-years-olds͵ respectively. CDC has paused PrEP coverage reporting to determine the best methodology for calculating PrEP coverage͵ and to update PrEP coverage estimates using updated methods and sources. Until updated PrEP coverage estimates are published͵ CDC advises against citing specific PrEP coverage data points͵ as historical estimates will be updated.
   The 'Sex' column is used for either sex assigned at birth or gender identity.
